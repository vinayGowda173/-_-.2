                        <p>C is a powerful, structured programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. Known for its speed and efficiency, C allows low-level access to memory, making it ideal for system programming like operating systems and embedded systems. Its syntax includes features such as functions, pointers, and structured control statements (if, for, etc.). C is also highly portable, allowing code to run on various platforms with minimal changes. While it requires manual memory management and lacks built-in error handling, C serves as a foundation for many modern languages like C++ and Java.</p></div>
                        <div id="java">
                            <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, led by James Gosling, and released in 1995. Known for its "write once, run anywhere" capability, Java code runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent. It supports key features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, promoting modular and reusable code. Java is widely used in web development, mobile apps (especially Android), and enterprise applications due to its robustness and extensive libraries. With automatic memory management via garbage collection, Java is safer and more user-friendly than low-level languages. It remains popular for its versatility, reliability, and scalability</p></div>

                                    JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web content. Developed by Netscape’s Brendan Eich in 1995, JavaScript is essential for front-end development and is executed in the browser, allowing for responsive and engaging web applications. It’s an interpreted language, meaning it doesn’t require compilation, and it supports both functional and object-oriented programming styles. JavaScript’s asynchronous capabilities (via callbacks, promises, and async/await) make it efficient for handling web interactions. With frameworks like Node.js, it can also be used for server-side development, making it a full-stack solution. JavaScript's widespread support and active community have made it a core technology in modern web development.
